### Variables 

- Var = is used since begining of the JS, [we dont prefer var because it is globally scoped, can cause conflict with variables with same name ]
- const = added in ES6 (ES2015) huge update, const doesnt let reassignment of values (constant)
- let = varibles are not globally scoped 
- rule = use const unless you are sure that you are going to reassing a value
